# Prayas-google-sol-chall-2022
This project for submission of google soluntion challenge 2022,it covers the UN Sustainable Development Goals of Decent work and economic growth "as the global economy continues to recover we are seeing slower growth, widening inequalities, and not enough jobs to keep up with a growing labour force. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015"

##PROBLEM 
As covid-19 has led to massive job losses and the main among were women and youth and even men too.
In 2020 the unemployment rate reached 6.5 per cent, the number of unemployed people increased by 33 million and there was huge unemployment in the labour market, 81 million workers got unemployed.
Talking about youth and women, they were especially hard to hit, 8.7 per cent of women got unemployed and 5.0 per cent of youth got unemployed in this pandemic.
In this world, we have made every technology for food, jobs, medical and what not but what about the people who work in our homes, what about the people who work in construction that is labour.
We have done a survey, in which we got to know almost 95% labour are searching for jobs daily and they even are ready to do any kind of work just for money sake, after pandemic the labours who were working in companies got unemployed and now they are searching in any kind of work, In the survey, we got to know that 70% labour has more than 4 members are there in the family including their kids, due to unemployment kids are forced to work that is child labour because of economic conditions of their family.
##SOLUTION
The main challenge is unemployment all over the world and for solving this issue we have  made a platform to minimise unemployment
To increase the employment rate and safe environment for work for labour/workers/vendors we will be making a platform for workers and common people, who can higher labour directly from our platform and from our platform labour can directly find work for them Our platform will be available in all local languages of that respective country/cities and also will be using google assistant on our platform for easy use of our platform from both labour and user side. For those workers who don't know how to use our platform and are not familiar with technology, we will be installing kiosk machines in countries/ cities within a radius of 15 km. Labour has to register once and then they can log in next time from the fingerprint and can find work from that machine.
#WORKING
###USER SIDE: From our platform Users(people who will be hiring)  will log in/signup by google authentication and then they will post hiring alerts on our platform with details of category work, worker no, work location and work location photo.

###LABOR SIDE: Once labour use our platform/kiosk machine they will have to register for one time and from the next time They will log in by their fingerprint, after logging in they can find work according to their needs/category of work they will be given work by their best preference after that they can accept that work, the details will be forwarded to hiring party with their contact details and photo and they will be getting the contact details of hiring party or they can even reject and find the work again according to them.
##Technology used(google) :-* 
###For frontend :-
1.HTML – Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used for structuring and placing content. Think of this as the framework that tells everything where to go.
2.CSS – Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) determine how the content displays. It controls colours, fonts, layout, etc. Think of this as the paintbrush that tells everything how to look.
3.JavaScript – Enables interactivity and enhances the functionality of a website or app. This is the part that tells everything that to do.
4. bootstrap:- Bootstrap is an open and free HTML, CSS and JS toolkit that is used by web developers to create responsive website designs quickly and effectively.

###For backend we 
1.Node js:- Node js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 
Use in-app:- We use node js to write our server-side scripting,  in server-side scripting we have Written a sort that sorts data according to the range of area.

2.Firebase by google:- Firebase Realtime Database, an API that synchronizes application data across iOS, Android, and Web devices, and stores it on Firebase's cloud. The product assists software developers in building real-time, collaborative applications. 

Use in-app:- we use firebase authentication to use our login and signup option,
And we use firebase's real-time database to store work requests from the user side.
And to show to workers on real-time bases. we have used firebase cloud messaging 

3.Google Cloud Platform:- Google Cloud Platform provides infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and serverless computing environments.
